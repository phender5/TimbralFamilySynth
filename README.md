Sythesis of Timbral Families

Paul Henderson - CSC484D

The goal of this project is to create an educational notebook to be used by future classes of CSC484D on Paul Lansky and Kenneth Steiglitz paper: Synthesis of Timbral Families by Warped Linear Prediction. There will be a Jupyter notebook that includes figures, calculations, audio samples, and Python code to demostrate the purpose and findings of this paper.

The notebook can be found in this repository under the name TimbralFamilySynth.ipynb and run like a typical notebook (run each cell, including this initial installs and imports). This project aims to demonstrate the academic paper Synthesis of Timbral Families by Warped Linear Prediction. At a basic level it will describe the paper's purpose and contributions, at an expected level it will walk through the paper using code and audio samples to demonstrate the paper's findings, at an advanced level the notebook will attempt to take these findings further and attempt it on other instruments (for example instead of violin to viola, cello, and bass it could try to follow the techniques to transform an alto saxophone to a tenor, baritone, and/or soprano).

The notebook already contains the major outline for this project, therefore each block of code is its own milestone. The test to see if these milestones are reached are if the code works as described in the markdown section above (containing the findings, calculations, and figures from the paper).
